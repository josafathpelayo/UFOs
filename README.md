# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to help Dana to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. By using JavaScript and improving her index.html file, more table filters can be apllied so that users can be more percise in their search. In addition to the date filter, the city, state, country, and shape filters will be added.


## Results
At first their was only a filter by date so if anyone wanted to use website, they would only be able to search what was on that specific date. By adding four more filters, anyone who wants to research on ufo sighting can be more specific. A test run on how the filters work with having only date 1/1/10 as the main date is shown below.

- Ex.) By City
  - Only Benton was searched

- Ex.) By State
  - Only California (ca) was searched

- Ex.) By Country
  - Only US was searched

- Ex.) By Shape
  - Only light shape was searched

## Summary
One draw back from this design is that one can be as specific as possible for the filters, yet, there's none for the duration of the UFO sighting. Another drawback is that there's comments for the sighting, but no link or citation of the source of the comments. This is a big issue as most people who researchers like looking into sources to expand their research umbrella and to see if the source is credible. One recommendation I would suggest is to include sources of the data that was collected or even adding it to the table. One can never have enough filters to make the data table more manipulative. Another recoomensation is to add a download button for the data.js file so analyst or users themselves want to use the data to their liking and possible having another download button for the table to be downloaded with the filters applied. These would be good options so that users can simply visit the website and have local access to their research. In conclusion, their always a better way to do things, but looking at it through a researcher's perspective, adding these option can make it easier.
